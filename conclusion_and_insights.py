    # Key Findings Section
    st.markdown("### Key Findings")
    st.markdown("""
    1. **Age**: Older individuals tend to have a higher likelihood of the target condition, emphasizing the importance of age as a risk factor.
    2. **Sex**: The analysis shows a higher prevalence of the condition among males compared to females, indicating potential gender-specific health implications.
    3. **Chest Pain Type (cp)**: Certain chest pain types are strongly associated with the target variable, serving as a significant predictor.
    4. **Exercise Induced Angina (exang)**: Exercise-induced angina is positively correlated with the target condition, highlighting the importance of stress testing.
    5. **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**: Variations in the slope are strongly linked to the target, suggesting its role in evaluating heart health.

    # Conclusion Section
    st.markdown("### Conclusion")
    st.markdown("""
    The analysis confirms that key features such as **age**, **sex**, **chest pain type**, and **exercise-induced angina** play a significant role in predicting the target condition.
    These insights align with known cardiovascular risk factors, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and personalized healthcare interventions.

    # Recommendations Section
    st.markdown("### Recommendations")
    st.markdown("""
    1. **Focus on Early Screening**: Prioritize early screening for individuals with high-risk factors like advanced age or specific chest pain types.
    2. **Promote Gender-Specific Health Programs**: Design targeted healthcare initiatives addressing the higher risk among males.
    3. **Leverage Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of the condition, aiding in proactive healthcare.
    4. **Encourage Lifestyle Changes**: Advocate for lifestyle adjustments, including regular exercise and stress management, especially for high-risk groups.

    # Limitations Section
    st.markdown("### Limitations")
    st.markdown("""
    - The dataset lacks certain variables (e.g., lifestyle habits, family history) that could provide a more comprehensive analysis.
    - The sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings. Larger, more diverse datasets are recommended for further validation.

    # Next Steps Section
    st.markdown("### Next Steps")
    st.markdown("""
    - Perform advanced feature engineering to explore interactions between variables.
    - Implement predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to assess the accuracy of predictions based on the identified factors.
    - Validate the findings with external datasets to ensure robustness and applicability.
